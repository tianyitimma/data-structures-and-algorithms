# stack-queue-pseudo


## Feature Tasks

- Create a new class called pseudo queue.
  - Do not use an existing Queue.
  - Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
  - Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

- Methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: value
    - Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  - dequeue
    - Arguments: none
    - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
